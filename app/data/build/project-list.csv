At least forty species of plants hailing from various temperate and subtropical climates around the world live in the sanctuary. Some evolved right here in the New York City area, others originated in Central America, Northern Africa, or the mountains of Japan. Although they have diverse origins, all have made the city their home. They are well-adapted to living alongside humans, although we often tend to ignore, malign or even intentionally destroy them. In Bushwick, the open earth they occupy is rapidly receding as new parking lots, condominiums, and other development projects fill in the neighborhood’s remaining “vacant” spaces. This weedy sanctuary provides the opportunity to see these plants up close in an unusual context. I invite you to take a break from winter in the city. Come relocate and rehabilitate alongside the sanctuary inhabitants, and imagine for a moment a vision of urban ecology that takes what is, not what was, as its starting point.",Sanctuary for Weedy Species is a living collection of more than three hundred wild/invasive/exotic or otherwise uncultivated young plants transplanted from Bushwick’s urban soil to the Gallery at Industry City.,,

Founded in 1910, Masonic Village was built as a completely self-sustaining retirement community for Masons. They grew their own food - cattle for beef and milk, orchards for fruit, and plenty of vegetables. During the 70’s, the USDA imposed more regulations on farms and labor costs increased exponentially. While Masonic Village is still an active retirement community (not just for Masons), only the beef cattle and fruit orchards are still operating. The head farmer, Frank Stolfutz, has been on the farm since the 80’s and keeps a close, scientific eye on the herd. Masonic Village has a cow-calf operation, meaning they have momma cattle that produce calves that Frank finishes for beef.","Masonic Village Farm is part of a former Free Mason commune.
